Authentication to AWS API




**Setting Up Secure Authentication to AWS API**

To set up secure authentication, i  create an IAM role and policy, then create an IAM user and assign it to the role. Attach the policy to the user and generate programmatic access credentials (access key ID and secret access key).

**Installing and Configuring AWS CLI**

I Download and install the AWS CLI, then configure it with the access key ID and secret access key. Understand what an API is and its relevance to AWS, and configure the CLI to use the access key ID and secret access key.

**Testing the Configuration**

I Tested the configuration by running a basic command to list all AWS regions. This verifies that the CLI is configured correctly and can communicate with AWS services.
